### Usage

#### - Setup in *application.conf*

In your `application.conf` add your application client id, secret and redirect uri.  
If you don't have them yet, get these [here](https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/).
```
CLIENT_ID = "my-client-id"  
CLIENT_SECRET = "my-client-secret"  
REDIRECT_URI = "http://localhost:9000/my-callback-endpoint"
```

#### - Inject the endpoints that you need

In your Controller (e.g. with *Play Framework*):

```
import play.api.mvc._  

import com.google.inject.Inject
import it.turingtest.spotify.scala.client.entities._
import it.turingtest.spotify.scala.client.{BaseApi, AuthApi, PlaylistsApi, ProfilesApi, TracksApi}
 
import scala.concurrent.Future  
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

 
class MyController @Inject() (api: BaseApi,
                              profilesApi: ProfilesApi,
                              tracksApi: TracksApi) extends Controller {

   def hello() = {
    val user: Future[UserPrivate] = profilesApi.me 
    user map { me => Ok(views.html.myview(s"Hello, ${me.id}")) }
  }
 
  
}

```

### **oAuth**

For requests which don't need user permissions, this client will use the *client credentials flow*.
Otherwise you need to set up the *Authorization Code Grant*: 

```
import it.turingtest.spotify.scala.client.AuthApi

def auth = Action {
    Redirect(authApi.authoriseURL(state = Some("state"), scopes = List(PLAYLIST_READ_PRIVATE), showDialog = true))
}
```

In this example, the controller action redirects the user to the Spotify Authorization page
where he needs to grant the permissions listed in the `scopes` parameter (e.g. here to read private
playlists).

The parameters of `authoriseURL` are:
+ **state**: an optional String of your choice, default is empty. You can generate a random string
or encode the hash of some client state (e.g. a cookie) and validate the response to make sure 
it is genuine and prevent attacks such as CSRF.
+ **scopes**: a List of `Scope` case objects, such as `PLAYLIST_MODIFY_PUBLIC` or `USER_READ_EMAIL`.
  These are basically the permissions that you need from the users of your app. Read more about scopes [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/using-scopes/).
+ **show_dialog** Whether or not to force the user to approve the app again if theyâ€™ve already done so.
It defaults to true here.

You can call `authoriseURL` without parameters 
if you want; but it will be a request with empty state, no scopes and show_dialog set to true.
(If no scope is specified, access is permitted only to publicly available information, and you
might get a response error.

After the user has granted or rejected permissions, he is redirected to the url value defined in 
your `application.conf` under `REDIRECT_URL`. The request's should contain a 'code' querystring,
which you need to give to the wrapper in order to set up oAuth.

To set oAuth you can either use `authApi.setAuth(code: String)` 
or `authApi.setAuthAndThen(code: String)(request: Token => Future[T])`
which lets you declare an action straight away after the user has granted
permissions:

In your `conf/application.conf`:
```
REDIRECT_URI = "http://localhost:9000/callbackEndpoint"
```

In your `conf/routes`:

```
GET /callbackEndpoint   controllers.MyController.callbackAction
```

In your controller:

```

import play.api.mvc._  

import com.google.inject.Inject
import it.turingtest.spotify.scala.client.entities._
import it.turingtest.spotify.scala.client.{AuthApi, ProfilesApi}
 
import scala.concurrent.Future  
import scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

 
class MyController @Inject() (authApi: AuthApi,
                              profilesApi: ProfilesApi) extends Controller {

   def hello() = {
    val user: Future[UserPrivate] = profilesApi.me 
    user map { me => Ok(views.html.myview(s"Hello, ${me.id}")) }
  }
 
  def callbackAction: Action[AnyContent] = Action.async {
    request =>
      request.getQueryString("code") match {
       // If the user rejected the permissions, or some other error occurred,
       // request should contain an "error" querystring instead of a "code".
        case Some(code) => api.setAuthAndThen(code) { _ => hello() }
        case None => request.getQueryString("error") match {
          case Some("access_denied") => Future(BadRequest("You need to authorize permissions in order to use the App."))
          case Some(error) => Future(BadRequest(error))
          case _ => Future(BadRequest("Something went wrong."))
        }
      }
  }
  
}

```

After you call `authApi.setAuth` or `authApi.setAuthAndThen`, you have set *oAuth* and can make user-specific requests.
If you don't set the authorisation code you will get an error such as "Authorisation code not provided" 
if you make an *oAuth* request. Once this is set, the client will automatically take care 
of refreshing future tokens.

Some endpoints don't need *oAuth*, so you can still call them if you don't set it.
Just read the docs of the endpoint you need to make sure it doesn't require authorisation.
For non-*oAuth* requests, the client will use the *client credentials* flow in order to
benefit of higher rates.

### Logging

In your *conf/logback.xml*:

```
  <logger name="spotify-scala-client" level="INFO"/>

```

**INFO** will log all the requests.  
**DEBUG** will log all the responses.
